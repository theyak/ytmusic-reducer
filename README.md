Reduce the number of times YouTube Music plays overplayed and thumbed-down songs

Next to the current track being played is a new control with an up and down arrow.
Click the arrows to determine how often a song should play when it is attempted to
be played by YouTube Music. This can also be done at the artist level when
viewing the artist page.

Click the pyramid icon in the top right to manage the tracks that you have 
set probabilities on.
